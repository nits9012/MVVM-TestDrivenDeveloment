What is a unit test?

A unit test is a function you write that tests something about your app. It tests just one thing in isolation. For example, if your app adds up the total amount of time your user spent doing something, you might write a test to check if this total is correct. Unit tests should be automated, and they should run fast. That way, you can run them right after you build your app to see if any code changes you introduced broke your app.


What sorts of things can you test?

Pretty much everything. If it is a product of your code, you can test it. In our iOS projects, we have written unit tests for all sorts of things. Here are some more examples.

Making sure a view controller has all of its outlets hooked up so our app doesn't crash unexpectedly when the controller is presented.
Making sure text that is only supposed to appear on a Monday only appears on a Monday without having to wait until next Monday to find out.
Making sure a tableview has a cell registered for a nib file that is external to it, and that it won't cause the app to crash when the tableview tries to get the cell.
